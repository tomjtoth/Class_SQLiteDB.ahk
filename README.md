# Class_SQLiteDB.ahk
- snatched from https://github.com/kczx3/SQLiteViewer/blob/master/lib/Class_SQLiteDB.ahk
- comments and descriptions removed
- SQLite function descriptions added here and there, while trying to understand them...
- slight modifications to suit my needs
# what works so far (with AHK v2 a123)
- Exec()
- GetTable()
